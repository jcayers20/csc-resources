Dear <proctor name>,

Thank you very much for agreeing to proctor exams for my students this semester.
The first midterm exam will take place during class time on <date>. It will be
administered digitally through Moodle. Students may use the following materials
on the exam:

	*	As much blank scratch paper as needed
	
	*	One page (8.5"x11"; front/back) of notes
	
	*	Calculator (scientific or graphing)
	
	*	Standard Normal and Student t Distribution Tables
	
		-	See attachment: please print and provide them to students

Students may use their own laptops, or you may provide them with one. The use
of other electronic devices (e.g. smartphones, smartwatches, etc.) is strictly
prohibited. In addition, students should not have any tabs other than the test
tab open at any time. If a student uses any other electronic device or attempts
to use his/her computer for any purpose other than taking the exam, please
inform me so that I can apply a score of zero to his/her exam. The test has a
strict time limit of 80 minutes. Please remind students to use the restroom,
get a drink, etc. prior to beginning; once the timer begins, it cannot be
paused.

In order to access the exam, students will need to enter a password. The
password for the exam is:

	<passcode>

Please do not provide this passcode prior to test day.

Should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out
to me. Thanks again for your willingness to proctor the exam!
